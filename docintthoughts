You've hit on the most critical step: mapping the Enterprise IDP Workflow Stages to your Phased Migration Tiers. This clearly shows what you own and where your effort shifts in each phase.
Here is the consolidation, detailing the What, Why, How, and Where for each of the seven core IDP stages across your three migration phases.
üó∫Ô∏è Phased Migration Alignment: Enterprise IDP Workflow
Phase 1: Quick Time to Market (Tiers 1 & 3 Focus) üöÄ
Goal: Establish immediate functionality and high baseline accuracy using proprietary cloud services. Minimize internal development effort.
| IDP Stage | WHAT (Action) | WHY (Rationale) | HOW (Component) | WHERE (Cost/Control) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Ingestion | Format Detection & Triage. | Necessary for API routing and initial quality check. | Custom Python Script | Internal Code (Minimal) |
| 2. Digitization | OCR, Layout, and Reading Order. | Fastest way to get reliable, high-quality text from complex documents. | AWS Textract / Google Doc AI | Cloud API (High Cost, Low Control) |
| 3. Structuring | Table, Form, and Key-Value Extraction. | Highest initial accuracy for structured data without training. | AWS Textract / Google Doc AI | Cloud API (High Cost, Low Control) |
| 4. Intelligence | Semantic Reasoning & Complex RAG. | Best initial accuracy for complex, variable-text queries. | Managed LLM (GPT-4 / Claude) | External API (Highest Cost, Low Control) |
| 5. Validation | Automated Checks and HITL Queue. | Essential for Tier 3 Accuracy and establishing the feedback loop. | Custom Pydantic Schemas + Review Interface | Internal Platform (High Effort, High Value) |
| 6. Integration | Data Normalization and Export. | Finalizes data for enterprise systems. | Custom ETL Script / API Connectors | Internal Code (Medium Effort) |
| 7. Monitoring | Track Latency and API Costs. | Essential for managing high-cost structure. | Cloud Monitoring Tools (e.g., CloudWatch) | Internal Monitoring (Low Effort) |
Phase 2: Resilient, Scalable, & Zero Throttling (Tiers 2, 4, 5 Focus) üõ°Ô∏è
Goal: Eliminate the expensive, rate-limited commercial LLM by building a scalable, self-hosted intelligence layer. Shift cost from variable token fees to fixed infrastructure.
| IDP Stage | WHAT (Action) | WHY (Rationale) | HOW (Component) | WHERE (Cost/Control) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Ingestion | Format Detection & Pre-processing. | Preparing text for local indexing. | Python Script + Basic Cleanup | Internal Code (Medium Effort) |
| 2. Digitization | OCR, Layout, and Reading Order. | Maintain Tier 3 Stability while focusing resources on the core RAG engine migration. | AWS Textract / Google Doc AI | Cloud API (High Cost, Low Control) |
| 3. Structuring | Table, Form, and Key-Value Extraction. | Maintain Tier 3 Stability. | AWS Textract / Google Doc AI | Cloud API (High Cost, Low Control) |
| 4. Intelligence | Semantic Reasoning & RAG (MIGRATED). | Zero Throttling (Tier 4) and High Throughput (Tier 5) by controlling compute. | Self-Hosted LLM (e.g., Llama 3 8B) + Qdrant/Weaviate (on K8s) | Internal Infrastructure (Fixed Cost, High Control) |
| 5. Validation | Automated Checks and HITL Queue. | HITL data starts generating high-quality feedback for local LLM fine-tuning. | Custom Pydantic Schemas + Review Interface | Internal Platform (High Effort, High Value) |
| 6. Integration | Data Normalization and Export. | Stable component. | Custom ETL Script / API Connectors | Internal Code (Medium Effort) |
| 7. Monitoring | Track Throughput, Latency, and Infrastructure Health. | Essential for optimizing K8s resource allocation. | Prometheus/Grafana | Internal Infrastructure (High Effort) |
Phase 3: Cost Effective & High Control (Tier 6 Focus) üí∞
Goal: Eliminate all external API costs, achieve maximum control and cost-effectiveness, and fine-tune the entire pipeline for maximum accuracy on proprietary document types.
| IDP Stage | WHAT (Action) | WHY (Rationale) | HOW (Component) | WHERE (Cost/Control) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Ingestion | Format Detection & Simple Template Routing. | Directs high-volume, simple documents to zero-cost, rule-based extraction. | Python Script + Unstructured.io | Internal Code (High Control) |
| 2. Digitization | OCR, Layout, and Reading Order (MIGRATED). | Eliminate all recurring OCR page fees (Tier 6) and achieve data sovereignty. | Unstructured.io + PaddleOCR/Tesseract | Internal Infrastructure (Lowest Cost, Highest Control) |
| 3. Structuring | Table, Form, and Key-Value Extraction (MIGRATED). | Full control over extraction logic. | Unstructured.io / DeepDoctection + Custom Rules | Internal Infrastructure (Lowest Cost, Highest Control) |
| 4. Intelligence | Semantic Reasoning & RAG (OPTIMIZED). | Sustain Tier 3 Accuracy by fine-tuning the LLM on your specific HITL data. | Fine-Tuned Local LLM + K8s Optimization | Internal Infrastructure (Lowest Running Cost) |
| 5. Validation | Automated Checks and HITL Queue. | HITL data is used immediately for continuous model retraining (Tier 3). | Custom Pydantic Schemas + Review Interface + Automated Retraining Loop | Internal Platform (High Value) |
| 6. Integration | Data Normalization and Export. | Stable component. | Custom ETL Script / API Connectors | Internal Code (Medium Effort) |
| 7. Monitoring | Cost per Document & Model Drift. | Focus on cost reduction and long-term model health. | Prometheus/Grafana + Custom Cost Reporting | Internal Infrastructure (High Value) |
This plan clearly outlines the staged ownership of the technology stack, allowing your team to ramp up expertise while continuously delivering business value.
